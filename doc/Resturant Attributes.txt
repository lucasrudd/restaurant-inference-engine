Each resturant is represented as a clojure record (which is
equivelent to a Java class) with the following attributes:


Type of Cuisine - 8
Rating - 7
Location - 6
Price - 5
BYOB - 4
Atmosphere - 3
Diner's Allergies - 2
How long it has been in business - 1

Each attribute is assigned a weight from 1 - 8 (1 being the least
important, 8 being the most important) and is given a total score
of how strongly it fits the user's search criteria.

Perhaps include a "Potluck Dinner" option in which the user inputs
ONE criteria, and the program randomly assigns all the rest. Then
the resturant which most closely fits those criteria is returned.
